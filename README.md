# Automation

The goal of this project is to build a cli app to automate some tasks we are facing when we deploy in Landfiles.

When we deploy either in acceptance or production environment, we need to send to the rest of the team the list of tickets and change the status of tickets.

We are using API provided by Atlassian (JIRA) teams. This means that only projects hosted on Jira can use this application.

Other teams can use it but we assume they are using agile method ðŸ¤ª
